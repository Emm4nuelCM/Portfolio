# Emmanuel Camacho — Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my professional space on GitHub!
I’m a backend developer with a strong focus on **offensive cybersecurity** and **web application security**.

## 📄 About Me

I’m currently undergoing active training as a pentester, specializing in **vulnerability analysis**, **web application exploitation**, and **API security**.
I have experience performing both **manual and automated security testing**, contributing to technical audits that include:

* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — reflected, stored, and DOM-based
* IDOR vulnerabilities (Insecure Direct Object References)
* JWT attacks (weak algorithms, JKU, JWK, `kid` path traversal)
* XXE exploitation leading to SSRF
* Data exfiltration via OAST (out-of-band vulnerabilities)

I’m passionate about research, hands-on practice in real environments, and building projects that enhance security throughout the software development lifecycle.
